## ARTIST STATEMENT

My work explores the delicate balance between reality and imagination, seeking to capture fleeting moments of beauty and emotion that often go unnoticed in our fast-paced world. Through a combination of traditional and contemporary techniques, I create visual narratives that invite viewers to pause, reflect, and connect with their own experiences.

Whether working with oil on canvas, digital media, or mixed assemblage, my goal remains constant: to create art that resonates on both an aesthetic and emotional level. I believe in the transformative power of art to inspire dialogue, foster understanding, and bring beauty into everyday life.
